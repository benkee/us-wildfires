# US Wildfires

I was unable to commit the sqlite file to the repo via git lfs so I have left a placeholder empty text file in place.

Hoping this is ok alongside the assumption:

'The application should assume the database is available on the file system in the same
directory as the application (PHP) files.'

## To run
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
